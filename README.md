# my_store
This is a web store project that will allow users to creat an account with the store, add products to a cart, and checkout those products.
It will also have admin capabilities for store admins that consist of adding, modifying, and deleting products, as well as managing orders and users.
Currently the project has some but not all of these abilities.
As of now you(as a customer) are able to: Sign up/sign in, view all other aspects of the store.
As of now you(as an admin) are able to: view all oders and customer information, as well as add products and categories to the store.

***BUG LIST***
However as of now you are not able to (as an admin): see the added products in store.
As a customer: checkout (caused by not being able to see the products).
